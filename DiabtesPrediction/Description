The Diabetes Prediction project uses machine learning to identify whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical data.
It utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which includes features like glucose level, BMI, age, insulin, and blood pressure.
The data is preprocessed and normalized to ensure better model performance.
Classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM are trained to make predictions.
Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
This project demonstrates the practical use of ML in the healthcare domain for early diagnosis.
It helps in understanding classification problems and real-world medical data handling.
Ideal for intermediate learners exploring healthcare analytics and predictive modeling.
