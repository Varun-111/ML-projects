The Loan Status Prediction project applies machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not.
It uses a dataset containing applicant information such as income, employment status, credit history, loan amount, and more.
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest are used for model training.
Model performance is measured using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation techniques.
The project simulates real-world financial risk assessment used by banks and lending institutions.
It highlights key ML concepts like feature engineering, model evaluation, and binary classification.
Great for learners aiming to build predictive models in the finance and lending sector.
