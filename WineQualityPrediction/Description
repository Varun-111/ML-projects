This Wine Quality Prediction project uses machine learning to predict the quality of wine based on physicochemical properties.
It employs datasets containing attributes like acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content.
Models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Linear Regression are used for prediction and analysis.
The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and RMSE.
It provides insights into how data science can assist in food and beverage quality control.
Ideal for learners exploring regression models and real-world datasets in machine learning.
