This Rock vs Mine Prediction project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals as rocks or mines (underwater mines).
It utilizes the Sonar dataset, where each instance represents sonar readings bounced off different objects.
The project includes data preprocessing, model training (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM), and evaluation.
It demonstrates concepts like feature scaling, classification, and model accuracy measurement.
Useful for understanding real-world applications of ML in defense and sonar-based detection.
Great for intermediate learners exploring signal classification using supervised learning.
