This Fake News Prediction project uses machine learning to classify news articles as real or fake.
It involves text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF).
Models like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes are trained on labeled datasets to make accurate predictions.
The project highlights key concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms.
It helps users understand how misinformation can be detected using AI techniques.
Suitable for intermediate learners looking to explore ML applications in real-world problems.
