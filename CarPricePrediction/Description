The Car Price Prediction project aims to estimate the selling price of a car based on its features using machine learning.
Initially, we modeled the problem using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression to understand the baseline performance.
Later, for improved accuracy and robustness, we implemented the XGBoost algorithm, which gave better results.
The dataset includes features such as car brand, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.
Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
We evaluated the models using metrics like RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
The project demonstrates how advanced regression algorithms can enhance prediction performance.
It showcases real-world applications of ML in the automobile resale market.
Ideal for learners exploring regression techniques, feature engineering, and ensemble learning.
A great step toward understanding price prediction and decision-making using machine learning.
